# Hello there! 
 
I'm Vdsz, an IT, Networking and Programming student in Hungary. While I have learned bits and pieces of all these major parts of IT, my primary interest in it is programming.  
 
I learned and practiced PHP, Blade, Laravel, Arduino (C++ variant), HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript and MySQL during 2024 Q1 and Q2.  
I learned and practiced basic levels of C, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript during 2024 Q3 and Q4.  
 
***Currently I don't use GitHub much. What I mainly used the site for in the past was to report bugs and share ideas for a now shut down Minecraft community server, coded my Discord bot, as well as uploaded, supervised and maintained a school project. The about me used to have more information but as of now it is pointless to put it back in, maybe once I'll be more active.***
