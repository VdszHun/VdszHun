# Hello there! 

I'm Vdsz, an IT, Networking and Programming student in Hungary.  
  
I studied before (2+ years of basic knowledge for most): 
- **C#**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript** 
- **Bootstrap**
- **MySQL**
- **Ubuntu Linux**.

I started studying recently (less than 3 months of experience):

- **PHP, Blade and Laravel**
- **Git**
- **Arduino IDE (C++ variant)**
- **SolidWorks 2020**

I studied and used **Discord.js** on my own to develop a personal Discord bot which is an inactive project for now.  
I use **Cisco Packet Tracer** to study and make networks.    
I had a few classes about **Debian Linux**, but my knowledge of that is nowhere near as of Ubuntu Linux.  
Programs I use for studying: Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, Arduino IDE 2.2.1, Cisco Packet Tracer and Virtual Box.  

***Currently I don't use GitHub much, I hope it changes in the future though. What I mainly used the site for in the past was to report bugs and share ideas for a now shut down Minecraft community server, as well coded my Discord bot mentioned above.***  

**My accomplishments and future goals:**
- [x] Basic level English Graduation (July 5, 2022 with 90% score ^^)
- [x] Office Software and Linux secondary profession qualification (February 15, 2023)

- [x] Graduation of my profession (This includes IT, Networking, HTML, CSS, C# (Windows Form and Console Apps), JavaScript and MySQL) (May-June 2023)
